# msfs-challenge-creator
- Run and select MSFS Packages directory first
- Make sure to select the packages directory containing the folders "Community" and "Official"
- Create or edit approaches
- Use button "Deploy approach" to configure the MSFS landing challenge
- In MSFS, select Landing Challenges, Famous, Generic Challenge to fly

* Note: restarting from the menu after you landed will load the newly deployed approach, so you don't need to go back to main menu. This will not work if you use "ESC - Restart"

# Known issues
- Occasionally the heading will not be interpreted correctly by MSFS (but is correctly set in the mission file)
- MSFS will not always reload the mission file when aborting or crashing an approach
